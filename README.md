# Robin Options
Greatly extends the availability of information in Robinhood, specifically with options. Still in development. Made possible thanks to:

Purpose?
- For one reason or another, you may be on the Robinhood brokerage and be unable (or reluctant) to switch to another brokerage with more sophisticated features, such as ThinkOrSwim. Robinhood provides a superficial view of critical data relating to options contracts, such as the greeks. Unlike ThinkOrSwim, for example, you may find it inconvenient that you are unable to view the net delta position of your portfolio for a given ticker at a glance. Thus, this simple program aims to supplement options data in Robinhood to aid its existing userbase with the help of the Robinhood API.

Features?
- TBA
